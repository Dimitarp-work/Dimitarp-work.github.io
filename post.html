      <h2>Study choice</h2>
      <h5>11 September, 2024</h5>
      <p>
        As a networking student, I've often been asked why I decided to dive deeper into Information and
        Communication Technology (ICT). For me, the choice wasn’t just about expanding my knowledge in networking
        but about understanding the broader landscape in which networking operates. I was
        fascinated by how
        interconnected the world had become and how critical effective communication systems were to almost every
        facet of modern life. From the seamless flow of information between devices to the vast networks that
        underpin global economies, ICT wasn’t just a field of study it was the backbone of our digital age.

      <h2>Programming experience</h2>
      <h5>11 September, 2024</h5>
      <p>
        My proficiency in Python and C++, combined with a strong grasp of electronics and experience with PCB
        building software, provides a robust foundation for tackling diverse and challenging projects. Here’s a
        closer look at how these skills come together to shape my work. Intermediate Programming Skills: Python and C++
        Python: My experience with Python enables me to tackle a variety of programming tasks with efficiency and
        ease. Known for its simplicity and versatility, Python is my go-to language for writing scripts,
        automating tasks, and developing applications. Its extensive libraries and frameworks, such as NumPy for
        numerical computations and Flask for web development, allow me to build and deploy solutions quickly.
        Python’s readability also facilitates easier debugging and maintenance, making it a valuable tool in my
        development toolkit.

        C++: With a solid foundation in C++, I am equipped to handle performance-critical tasks and delve into
        more complex programming challenges. C++’s strengths in system-level programming and its support for
        object-oriented principles allow me to develop high-performance applications and work on projects
        requiring fine-grained control over system resources. Whether it's game development, real-time
        simulations, or system programming, C++ provides the flexibility and power needed to meet demanding
        technical requirements.

    <div id="firstFeedback">
      <h2>First feedback</h2>
      <h5>11 September, 2024</h5>
      <p>
        The first feedback i received was generally positive. Yes there are some bugs, but that's normal and as
        long i fix them it will be fine. The styling was well received. Most people said they like the clear and
        easy to use ui of my website, but some people didn't like the cooler combination, which is normal. Not
        everyone will like it, but it's my website, so I accept a different view point, but i will not change the
        coolers. On the other hand, spacing in both code and website was tragic (silly me). I will, of course,
        reformat the code and fix the design issues. Also, very importantly, a large part of the CSS was mixed
        because the index page and the general styling were together and thus great, a 400 line file of spaghetti
        would, of course, split them into individual files. The sidebar was at the bottom because it was rushed
        and i hid it but yes, it has to be majorly improved. The ui is no good. It is too basic and, yes, my
        styling is more minimalistic, but this is not acceptable, also some of the links were not opening in a new
        tab (again silly me) i will rework the sidebar and make it more present on the website. And lastly, the
        blog/post page. Yes, the blog page was ready at 90% but the post page at the time of the showcase of the
        websites was disabled because it was not ready and i just used a read more/read less blog page rather than
        a linked feed page. Of course, I will implement this later in my fixes.

    <div id="theEfect">
      <h2>The efect of AI on the ICT working feild.</h2>
      <h5>11 September, 2024</h5>
      <p>
        Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming industries across the globe, and the Information and
        Communication Technology (ICT) field is no exception. Network Optimization: AI algorithms can analyze vast
        amounts of network data to
        identify patterns and
        optimize performance. Machine learning models predict traffic loads, dynamically adjust bandwidth
        allocation, and enhance overall network efficiency.

        Automated Troubleshooting: AI-driven diagnostic tools can identify and resolve network issues with minimal
        human intervention. Predictive maintenance, powered by AI, helps prevent network failures by anticipating
        problems before they arise.

        Intelligent Network Management: AI can streamline network management tasks through automation. For
        example, AI systems can handle routine configurations and updates, freeing IT professionals to focus on
        more strategic initiatives.

        Transforming Data Management and Analytics
        The ability to analyze and derive insights from vast amounts of data is crucial in the ICT sector. AI is
        revolutionizing data management and analytics by providing advanced tools for processing and interpreting
        information.

        Big Data Processing: AI algorithms can handle and analyze enormous datasets at speeds far beyond human
        capabilities. This capability enables more accurate predictions and insights from data.
